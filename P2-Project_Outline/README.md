## Submission Instructions

### Overview
FinSight is a data analytics application for people to easily enter their financial purchases and can analyze their financial history. Users for example could record their monthly subscriptions, shopping, and dining costs. FinSight sorts the user’s purchases into different spending categories and allows them to better understand their spending habits through data analytics. FinSight’s dashboard provides a visual history recap of your overall cost of each spending category and predicts future trends. By using FinSight, users can determine statistical trends in their financial history and gain insight to form good financial habits.

Users might find FinSight useful because it provides a more in depth data analysis of all their financial spending compared to other personal finance applications which only provides a surface level analytics of the user’s spending habits. FinSight was inspired by my growing passion for personal finance. A goal of mine is to better understand how to manage my own money and invest it wisely. Having used personal finance apps like Mint, I’ve realized how insightful gathering financial data of your personal expenses can be for you to make important financial decisions. 
### Features
User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each 
user will have a profile page and tailored data analysis of their personal expenses. 

Create Expense: Users will be able to post expenses to their financial log of how 
much they’ve spent on a purchase, the category of a purchase, and the date of the purchase.

Edit Expense: Users will be able to edit existing expenses to either update its description or delete it 

Data Timeline: Users can view their financial history in a data graph and financial trends.
### Technologies
Java
Javascript
Python

Spring Boot
React 
Pandas
MySQL

Docker 
### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to learn Spring Boot to securely authenticate users and display their corresponding dashboards. I will need to learn MySQL to allow users to properly record their expenses. I currently don’t know much about how to visualize data using the finances of the logged in user of the application. The product relies heavily on being able to visualize the user’s financial data accurately and effectively. I know that python libraries may be useful to create this feature of the project. I also want to learn about containerization using Docker.
